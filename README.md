=========================

CakePHP Helpers to generate HTML with @Twitter Boostrap style.

It's a work in progress, if you want to add any kind of bootstrap components, just do it!

If you want a component but you don't really know how to do, do not hesitate to contact me!

How to use?
===========

Just add Helper files into your View/Helpers directory and load the helpers in you controller:
```public $helpers = array('BoostrapHtml', 'BootstrapForm', 'BoostrapPaginator') ;```

I tried to keep CakePHP helpers style. You can find the documentation directly in the Helpers files.

BootstrapHtmlHelper
===================

This is the subclass of HtmlHelper, with 1 redefinition of method and 3 new methods:

<h3>getCrumbLists</h3>
Function now returns a bootstrap style breadcrumbs: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/components.html#breadcrumbs
  
<h3>alert</h3>
Function which returns a bootstrap alert message: http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/components.html#alerts
```
/**
    
    Create an Twitter Bootstrap style alert block, containing text.
    
    @param $text The alert text
    @param $options Options that will be passed to Html::div method
    
    Available BootstrapHtml options:
        - block: boolean, specify if alert should have 'alert-block' class
        - type: string, type of alert (default, error, info, success)

**/
BoostrapHtmlHelper::alert ($text, $options = array())
```   
3. icon is a method which returns a boostrap icon
4. progress is a method which returns a boostrap progress bar
